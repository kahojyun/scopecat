# Scopecat project console

Local-only React client for the Scopecat daemon. The production build is
designed to be served by the daemon so all API calls stay on relative
`/api/v1/*` paths.

```sh
pnpm install
```

For frontend development, run an API-only daemon and Vite in separate
terminals:

```sh
uv run --project ../.. scopecat serve <project> --api-only --port 8765
pnpm run dev
```

Vite proxies `/api` to `http://127.0.0.1:8765`. Set
`SCOPECAT_DAEMON_ORIGIN` to use a different local daemon address.

`pnpm run build` writes only to this application's ignored `dist/` directory.
From the repository root, use that bundle for a source-checkout preview with
`scopecat start <project> --static-dir apps/scopecat-ui/dist`.
The repository-level `scripts/build_server_distribution.py` assembles the
server in a temporary directory and verifies that its wheel and source
distribution contain the same bundle.

`pnpm-workspace.yaml` applies the same 14-day minimum release age as Renovate
to direct and transitive dependency resolution.

## Development checks

```sh
pnpm run format:check
pnpm run lint
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run test
```

Oxfmt owns layout and Oxlint owns correctness checks. Generated API types and
package-manager output are excluded; their producing tools remain authoritative.

## API contract

`src/api-schema.d.ts` is generated from the UI-used subset of the daemon's
OpenAPI contract. Run
`pnpm run generate:api` after changing a UI-used transport model; CI runs
`pnpm run check:api` so the generated contract cannot drift. Keep endpoint calls
and presentation mapping beside their owning feature or data domain, keep shared
transport behavior in `src/api-client.ts`, keep stable application aliases in
`src/api-contract.ts`, and treat the generated daemon contract as authoritative.

## Browser end-to-end test

```sh
pnpm run test:e2e:install
pnpm run test:e2e
```

The test first builds the current UI into `dist/` and passes that directory
explicitly to the daemon. It then
creates a temporary starter project, starts its daemon on a dynamic port,
executes the generated first notebook, and drives the daemon-served GUI through
a parameter default and undo. It also saves a notebook analysis candidate,
accepts it in the GUI, follows its provenance back to the producing run, and
restores the previous default. The fixture removes the daemon and project after
success or an assertion failure. If identity-safe daemon shutdown itself fails,
it retains the project and reports the daemon log for manual cleanup.
